Academic work I'm particularly proud of from my time at Chalmers and Waterloo. Wide range of topics, all from coursework.

## Chalmers

### TEK735 - Digitalization and Sustainability (Fall 2023)

Three essays on technology, sustainability, and AI ethics. Written in Swedish. Got 15/15 on all of them.

**[LCA Method & Sustainable Development](academic/chalmers-tek735-01-lca-sustainable-development.md)**

How Life Cycle Assessment can help us make better decisions about climate impact. Looks at what LCA does well and where it falls short.

**[Natural Capital & Climate Change](academic/chalmers-tek735-02-natural-capital-climate.md)**

Putting an economic value on nature to fight climate change. Covers both the potential and the problems with this approach.

**[Justice, Technology & AI Ethics](academic/chalmers-tek735-03-justice-technology-ai.md)**

Three case studies on fairness in tech: AI in US courts, cleaner cooking methods in India, and who actually benefits from electric vehicles. Looks at the tensions between environmental goals and social justice.

### DAT410 - Design of AI Systems (Spring 2025)

**[Frame-Based Dialogue System](https://github.com/harryden/dialogue-system)**

GUS-inspired dialogue system using hierarchical frames, demons, and servants. Handles weather, restaurant, and transit queries through recursive slot-filling architecture.

Group project with Elvina Fahlgren. Scored 100/100.

**[Automated News Headline Generation with BART and LoRA](academic/chalmers-dat410-headline-generation.pdf)**

Fine-tuned BART transformer model for generating news headlines from article descriptions. Used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training on 210k HuffPost articles. Achieved ~50% BLEU score while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Group project with Elvina Fahlgren. Scored 100/100.

## Waterloo

### CS651 - Data-Intensive Distributed Analytics (Fall 2024)

**[Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentiment Analysis](academic/waterloo-cs651-naivebayes-sentiment-analysis.pdf)**

Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch using Spark for sentiment analysis on 50k IMDb movie reviews. Achieved 85.1% accuracy with distributed computing and Laplace smoothing.

### CS680 - Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2024)

**[Autoencoders for Credit Card Fraud Detection](academic/waterloo-cs680-autoencoders-fraud-detection.pdf)**

Unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoders on 284k credit card transactions. Compared performance against SVM baseline and used LIME for explainability.
