Academic work I'm particularly proud of from my time at Chalmers and Waterloo. Wide range of topics, all from coursework.

## Chalmers

Three essays on technology, sustainability, and AI ethics. Written in Swedish. Got 15/15 on all of them.

**[LCA Method & Sustainable Development](academic/chalmers-tek735-01-lca-sustainable-development.md)**
