Academic work I'm particularly proud of from my time at Chalmers and Waterloo. Wide range of topics, all from coursework.

## TEK735 - Digitalization and Sustainability (Chalmers, Fall 2023)

Three essays on technology, sustainability, and AI ethics. Written in Swedish. Got 15/15 on all of them.

### [LCA Method & Sustainable Development](academic/chalmers-tek735-01-lca-sustainable-development.md)

How Life Cycle Assessment can help us make better decisions about climate impact. Looks at what LCA does well and where it falls short.

### [Natural Capital & Climate Change](academic/chalmers-tek735-02-natural-capital-climate.md)

Putting an economic value on nature to fight climate change. Covers both the potential and the problems with this approach.

### [Justice, Technology & AI Ethics](academic/chalmers-tek735-03-justice-technology-ai.md)

Three case studies on fairness in tech: AI in US courts, cleaner cooking methods in India, and who actually benefits from electric vehicles. Looks at the tensions between environmental goals and social justice.
